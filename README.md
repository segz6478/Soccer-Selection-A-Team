## Executive Summary

Rarita is looking to participate in the Football and Sporting Association (FSA) League. We are hired to:
*	Construct a competitive team; and
*	Analyse the impact of a Football brand on Rarita’s economy over the next 10 years.

In constructing a competitive team, below were the objectives:
*	Rarita ranking top ten of the FSA within the next five years; and
*	Rarita having a high probability of achieving a championship within the next 10 years.

The team selected for Rarita is comprised of 5 to 8 players for each position. The team will have a 99% probability of ranking within top 10 members of the FSA for the next 5 years and 95% of probability of placing in the top 3 within the next 10 years.
Over the 10 years, the investment of 995mil Doubloons allows Rarita to construct a competitive team without additional funding. While the venture is projected to remain profitable in most scenarios, consistent poor performance or a lack of consumer interest may result in lower revenue growth and create a going concern. 


## Team Selection

###	Steps
1.	Determined player's value based on playing statistics, position, and league (important indicator of the quality of opposition)
2.	Maximised the total value of a team whilst constraining the total player salary, number of players in a position and proportion of allocated value for each position
3.	Applied model to different salary caps to fit a polynomial equation linking salary and value
4.	After establishing a strong link between underlying team value and performance (Appendix B: Figure 1), determined the probability of placing top 10 using team data from the 2021 tournament (Appendix B: Figure 2) - probabilities were found by discounting the total team value back to 2021 at the superimposed inflation rate
5. Minimised the net present value (NPV) of the total player salaries each year (includes return on investment and superimposed inflation), whilst meeting the competitiveness requirement
6.	With the team budget for each year confirmed, players were selected
