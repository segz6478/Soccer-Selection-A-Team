## Executive Summary

Rarita is looking to participate in the Football and Sporting Association (FSA) League. We are hired to:
•	Construct a competitive team; and
•	Analyse the impact of a Football brand on Rarita’s economy over the next 10 years.
In constructing a competitive team, below were the objectives:
•	Rarita ranking top ten of the FSA within the next five years; and
•	Rarita having a high probability of achieving a championship within the next 10 years.
The team selected for Rarita is comprised of 5 to 8 players for each position. The team will have a 99% probability of ranking within top 10 members of the FSA for the next 5 years and 95% of probability of placing in the top 3 within the next 10 years.
Over the 10 years, the investment of 995mil Doubloons allows Rarita to construct a competitive team without additional funding. While the venture is projected to remain profitable in most scenarios, consistent poor performance or a lack of consumer interest may result in lower revenue growth and create a going concern.
